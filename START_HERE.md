## 🎯 WHAT THE APP DOES

### Two-Part Task Management
```
LEFT SIDE                    RIGHT SIDE
Non-Negotiables              Good to Do
─────────────                ──────────
Must do today (max 5)        Nice to have (unlimited)
Weight: 1-10                 Weight: 1-5
High priority                Bonus points
```

### Smart Scoring
```
Your Score = (Tasks You Complete / All Tasks) × 100%

Example:
Complete 3 of 5 tasks (with weights 8+7+5=20 out of 20)
→ Your Score = 20/20 = 100%
```
